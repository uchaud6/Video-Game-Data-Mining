Introduction:

Hello! This project, game_analyzing.py, is about creating functions that help to analyze a dataset about video game sales. The dataset is analyzed in csv format, and the original dataset 
can be found at "https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv". The csv file has relavent headers of 'Name, Platform, 
Year_of_Release, Genre, Global_Sales, Developer, Rating' (headers utilized in programming). Using the pandas and numpy modules, I will create five functions.

The highestsales(year) function is designed to find the highest selling game of a given year based on the given argument to the function in a form of a pandas dataframe. The highestgenres() 
function is designed to gather all the genres of the games in the dataset and place them in a dataframe with data showing how many games of each respective genre have been sold. The 
highestplatforms() function is designed to place all the platforms in the dataset into a dataframe showing how many games under each respective platform have been sold.The highestESRB() 
function is designed to place all the ESRB ratings in the dataset into a dataframe showing how many games with each respective rating have been sold. The highestdevelopers() function is 
designed to place all the developers in the dataset into a dataframe showing how many games under each respective developer have been sold (enable code in a comment of this function to get
a dataframe that only shows the top 106 developers in the dataset as opposed to the whole 1696 developers). All of these functions will return their mentioned pandas dataframes when called.


Files Needed:

game_analyzing.py - Main program file with five functions for data analysis

videogames.csv - Video game data file that is analyzed by project4.py


Insights from Data:

The highest selling games of the latest six years of the dataset have all fit under one of the the top three most successful genres with those being action, sports, and shooter games. This 
may hint that producing a game that fits under one of these three categories will give it a more likely chance to be successful. However, I feel that this data covering genres is too 
unreliable to make big claims since the highest selling action genre has around 1,745,269,000 games sold under its name, but the genre of 'action' can be applied to a game very easily with 
concepts of other genres like shooting, fighting, etc. being named under a very broad term as "action", which would explain why the action genre is ahead with sales. Some evidence to 
back my claim would be how 'action' is mentioned 3401 times while other genres aren't mentioned half as much as that in 'videogames.csv' (using ctrl F). For example, 'shooter' is only 
mentioned 1326 times.

The goal for seeing which consoles sold the most games was to see if the public was more likely to buy games on specific types of consoles. Of the ten consoles that sold the most games,
half of the consoles were from Sony's Playstation models, a third of the consoles were from Nintendo's products, Microsoft's Xbox 360 made the list, and PC gaming made the list as the 
tenth console with the most sold games. Therefore, Sony's Playstation models would seem to have the best success rate to sell games based on how many of their consoles have done so before.
It's impressive for PC systems to make the top ten consoles in this list as PC gaming is relatively new compared to tradtional console gaming, especially at the time of this dataset's 
completition of the year 2016, so this data shows how PC gaming has been on the rise.

The goal for seeing which games sold the most copies based on their ESRB ratings was to see if the public bought games for a specific age demographic. However, a large portion of games in
the dataset didn't actually have an ESRB rating, and while games rated E had the most games sold with around 2,851,000,000 games, rated T games and rated M games had much less but very
similar amount of games sold. Despite the rated E games having a larger amount of games sold, I believe there is no direct correlation with ESRB ratings and game sales as there are
many more rated E games in the market, and rated T and M games had very similar games sold. Meaning, at the very least, there isn't a linear correlation with how ESRB ratings sell copies
since the ratings of T for teen and M for mature have similar data.

The goal for seeing which ten developers have helped to sell the most games was just to show the developers who've had the most success in producing high-selling games. Of the highest
selling games in the latest six years of the dataset, three of the developers listed in highestdevelopers() worked on all but one of those games, with those devleopers being Treyarch,
Rockstar North,and EA Sports. This knowledge could be used to examine the tactics and design approach these companies use to be very successful in producing high-selling video games.
